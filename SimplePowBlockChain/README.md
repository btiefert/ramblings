What is this?
-------------
This is a simplified proof-of-work block chain, in the Satoshi school of distributed consensus.  This is intended as a proof of concept for learning purposes, so many things are simplified so that the core concepts take the center stage.  For example, there are no denial of service protections whatsoever.   Please feel free to use this as a learning exercise.   No warranty written or implied.
